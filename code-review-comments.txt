Code Review Comments from Michelle and Mike

Good points
- presentation was awesome
- good use of APIs (calendar, google gantt chart)
- index.js - good comments, clean organization. nothing weird. :D 
- css is beautiful.

Points to improve
- update your README.md (it still says Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Base Node App)
- very long functions need to be commented more, e.g. renderAddSchedule.
- // this loop is what I'm proudest of in this whole project.
  - good to also say how it works in the comments.
- routes.js  
  - lines 143-150, look very similar to 164-161. Could this be refactored into a function?
- gantt-chart.ejs
  - it's weird that the script for drawing the gantt, is above the html... we think maybe it should be below.
- calendar.ejs
  - lines 22, and 23 contain /head and body tags. but these are already in the header and footer... something weird here.
